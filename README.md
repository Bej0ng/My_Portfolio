## About me

My name is Jakub Gąsiorek. I am currently working as portal support, with a keen eye on transitioning into a career as a software tester. In my current role, I handle the crucial task of publishing and editing laser scan data of oil rigs, provided by our dedicated survey engineers, utilizing Ayelix Administrator. Additionally, I ensure seamless data flow from server to survey engineers using Ayelix Asset Manager. 

My journey into portal support began during a temporary assignment, where I showcased my skills as a piping engineer. Recognizing my potential, I was offered a permanent position as a key member of the Ayelix Portal team. 

In my current capacity, I am responsible for onboarding process of employees from diverse departments that are temporarily assigned to work on the Ayelix website. Taking charge in coordinating small teams for urgent projects, I oversee task delegation and reviews. Moreover, I actively contribute to software testing for new Ayelix versions, meticulously reporting and troubleshooting bugs. I also take part of testing of mobile app, that is soon to launched by our company.

Through these testing sessions, I've discovered interested for software testing within the realm of IT. I'm committed to continuous improvement, gearing up to transition into a full-time role as a software tester.
